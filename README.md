### Welcome to *lilinjn's* Institute for Search Research!
-----------------------------------------------------------
Just like Mitt, I'd like a binder full of kanren, and so I am collecting my assortment of notebooks on the topic in this repo. 

Each notebook implements a (typically self-contained) kanren in a conversational style, while exploring a spectrum of design issues.  The code is meant mostly to be read and twiddled interactively.  At some later point the various lessons learned may be baked into library form suitable for public consumption. 

### Pre-Rendered Notebooks
--------------------------
If you are just browsing, and would rather not be bothered by the hassles of cloning the repo, setting up IJulia, and such -- then the following links to pre-rendered versions of the notebooks may be the path for you:

* [FirstSteps]: A translation of µKanren with some exploration of Julia specific features to create nice syntax

[FirstSteps]:http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lilinjn/lilKanren/blob/master/FirstSteps.ipynb  

However, interactive fiddling is **highly** encouraged -- again, for those seeking the path of least resistance, juliabox wins the prize.

### Bucket List
--------------------------
* **Threading the Needle**: Experiments in syntax
* **"A Mere Trifle"**: A `Persisten Vector+Union-Find` constraint store and benchmarking paraphenalia
* **Look into the Abyss**: Visualizing the Geometry of Search
* **Searching for 𝕳𝔢𝔯𝔯 𝕯𝔬𝔨𝔱𝔬𝔯 𝕳𝔬𝔭𝔣**: No not that one, the other one.
