## Introduction
Just like Mitt, I'd like a binder full of kanren, and so here, I am collecting my assortment.  

Each kanren is developed in notebook style, typically self contained, and explores a spectrum of design issues.  The code is meant mostly to be read and twiddled interactively.  At some later point the various lessons learned may be baked into a form suitable for public consumption.  

If you are just browsing, and would rather not be bothered by the hassles of cloning the repo, setting up IJulia, and such -- then the following links to rendered versions of the notebooks may be the path for you:

* [FirstSteps]: A translation of µKanren with some exploration of Julia specific features to create nice syntax

## Notes
* **kanren**? cf. http://minikanren.org/
* **When development gets fast and furious**: nbviewer (the notebook rendering service) caches static rendering for 10 minutes.  Google for a magic url that forces a cache flush.
