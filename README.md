# Welcome to lilinjn's *Institute for Search Research*!

Just like Mitt, I'd like a binder full of kanren, and so I am collecting my assortment of notebooks on the topic in this repo. 

Each notebook implements a (typically self-contained) kanren in a conversational style, while exploring a spectrum of design issues.  The code is meant mostly to be read and twiddled interactively.  At some later point the various lessons learned may be baked into library form suitable for public consumption. 

### Pre-Rendered Notebooks
If you are just browsing, and would rather not be bothered by the hassles of cloning the repo, setting up IJulia, and such -- then the following links to pre-rendered versions of the notebooks may be the path for you:

* [FirstSteps]: A translation of µKanren with some exploration of Julia specific features to create nice syntax

[FirstSteps]:http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lilinjn/lilKanren/blob/master/FirstSteps.ipynb  

However, interactive fiddling is **highly** encouraged -- again, for those seeking the path of least resistance, juliabox wins the prize.

### Notes
* **kanren**? cf. http://minikanren.org/
* **Julia**? cf. http://julialang.org/
* **JuliaBox**? cf. http://juliabox.org/
* **When development gets fast and furious**: nbviewer (the notebook rendering service) caches static rendering for 10 minutes.  Google for a magic url that forces a cache flush.
