# This directory is deprecated!!!!

It remains so that some early notebooks will still function.  Please look to `../packages` for the current structure
(The change was made so one could easily add a particular version to the LOAD_PATH and also to support breaking up
 the code into submodules)



Intro
=============

* There is code here, but still not library quality
* Primarily it exists to explore alternate workflows besides IJulia, including
  * Juno
  * Emacs-ESS
